## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the challenges we ran into was that technologies are not very well developed in the space of mobile apps yet like they are for Web. Also, we are not very experienced in Flutter so it was also great to learn new things about this.

## How to Run the Application

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
